## What's with the name?
**Waydevil** is a play on the words _Wayland_, the display manager protocol for Linux/*NIX, and _devil_ - a reference to background processes in computing (**daemon**s).

**Waydevil** needn't run as a daemon ðŸ˜ˆ - one-time execution is sufficient to modify the required file(s).

**Waydevil** is an experimental utility to manage **Waybar** configuration files across different _Wayland compositors_.
